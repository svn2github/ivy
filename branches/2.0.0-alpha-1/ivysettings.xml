			we use ivyrep for ivy and some artifacts, and ibiblio for other artifacts
			The reason for that is that commons vfs is still not released, thus we depend on an integration
			version only available on ivyrep, but not on ivyrep
			As soon as vfs will be available on ibiblio, the default configuration could be used again

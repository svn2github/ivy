Ivy has not yet released a stable version under the Apache Incubator. Previous releases can be considered production quality, but are not endorsed by the Apache Software Foundation.

The latest release (unstable) is 2.0.0-alpha-1-incubating.

Downloads are available from online site:
http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/

<h2>Building from source</h2>
What you can get here at the ASF is the latest sources from the Subversion repository:
<code>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ivy/core/trunk ivy
</code>
Then to build Ivy from source, assuming you have ant 1.6.2+ and a jdk 1.4+ installed, then you only need to run the following command:
<code>
ant jar
</code>
Then you will find ivy.jar in <b>build/artifact</b>.</textarea>

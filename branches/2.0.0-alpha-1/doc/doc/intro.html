Welcome to Ivy reference documentation!

If you don't know Ivy at all, give a glance at its <a href="../features.html">features</a>, the <a href="../faq.html">FAQ</a> and the <a href="../doc/tutorial.html">tutorials</a> before digging into this reference documentation.

<li><a href="../doc/concept.html">Main Concepts</a></li>
This part introduces the main concepts used in Ivy: dependency resolvers, variables, patterns, and also a good introduction to a central ivy concept: module configurations.
<li><a href="../doc/principle.html">How does it work ?</a></li>

<li><a href="../doc/ivyfile.html">Ivy files</a></li>

<li><a href="../doc/ant.html">Use from ant</a></li>
This part describes how to use ivy from ant. It's in this section that all ant tasks brought by ivy are specified.
<li><a href="../doc/ant.html">Use standalone</a></li>

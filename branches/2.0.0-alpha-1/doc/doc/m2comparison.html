We are frequently asked how ivy compares to maven2, so we have decided togives some insight about our opinion on the subject.

Obviously this comparison is biased (hey, you are on official Ivy site :-)), but we'll try to keep it as fair as possible. Do not hesitate to add comment if you feel something is missing or false on this page. You can also have a look at <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Feature+Comparisons">Maven2 feature comparison page on codehaus</a>, which itself offers another point of view.

There have been also severa discussions on the subject, among which the one triggered by <a href="http://www.jayasoft.org/node/806.html">spring contemplating about switching to maven</a> is may be the more interesting.

But here is the points we think mainly differentiate maven2 and Ivy.

<h1>Comparing plants and apples</h1>
First, the most important difference between maven2 and ivy is that they aren't at all the same kind of tools. Maven2 is a software project management and comprehension tool, whereas Ivy is only a dependency management tool, highly integrated with ant, the popular build management tool. Maven2 offers dependency management facility, and that's why many ask how ivy compares to maven2. That's why we'll focus only on dependency management features of maven2 in this comparison.
So if you look for an out of the box software project management tool, you may skip the rest of this comparison and check what maven2 has to offer.

<h1>Different concepts</h1>
Ivy heavily relies on a unique concept called configuration. In ivy, a module configuration is a way to use or to see the module. For instance, you can have a test and runtime configuration in your module. But you can also have a mysql and an oracle configuration. Or an hibernate and a jdbc configuration. In each configuration you can declare what artifacts (jar, war, ...) are required. And in each configuration, you can declare your dependencies on other modules, and describe which configuration of the dependency you need. This is called configuration mapping, and it is a very flexible way to answer to a lot of problems we face very often in software development.

Maven2 on its side has something called the scope. You can declare a dependency as being part of the test scope, or the buildtime scope. Then depending on this scope you will get the dependency artifact (only one artifact per module in maven2) with its dependencies depending on their scope. Scopes are predefined in maven2 and you can't change that. No way to create an oracle scope. No way to indicate you need what as been declared to be needed in the runtime scope of your dependency in your compile one. Everything here is written in the marble.

And this leads to some kind of troubles... as Matt Raible stated in his <a href="http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd?anchor=maven_2_s_transitive_dependencies">blog</a> talking about maven2 dependencies:
[quote]
There are a *lot* of unnecessary dependencies downloaded for many libraries. For example, Hibernate downloads a bunch of JBoss JARs and the Display Tag downloads all the various web framework JARs. I found myself excluding almost as many dependencies as I added.
[/quote]
The problem is that hibernate can be used with several cache implementations, several connection pool implementation, ... And this can't be managed with scopes, wheres Ivy configurations offers an elegant solution to this kind of problem. For instance, in ivy, assuming hibernate as an ivy file like <a href="http://ivyrep.jayasoft.org/hibernate/hibernate/ivy-2.1.8.xml">this one</a>, then you can declare a dependency like that:
<code type="xml">
<dependency org="hibernate" name="hibernate" rev="2.1.8" conf="default->proxool,oscache"/>
</code>
to get hibernate with its proxool and oscache implemetations, and like that:
<code type="xml">
<dependency org="hibernate" name="hibernate" rev="2.1.8" conf="default->dbcp,swarmcache"/>
</code>
to get hibernate with dbcp and swarmcache.

<h1>Documentation</h1>
An important thing to be able to use a tool is its amount of documentation. With Ivy, even if they are written in broken english (would you have prefered well written french :-)), the printer friendly version of the documentation is now about 120 pages. 
With maven2, it's a bit difficult to clearly know what can be considered as dependency management documentation, but we didn't managed to find much: some small introductory guides, short entries in the pom reference guide, and not really much more. Even in the maven book you can get for free on <a href="http://www.mergere.com/">mergere website</a>, the insight about dependency management is still light in our point of view. 

<h1>Conflict management</h1>
Conflict management are an important part of dependency management, cause when dealing with transitive dependencies you often have to face conflicts. In this area, Ivy let you do whatever you want: use one conflict manager in one module, another one elsewhere, decide which revision you will get, ... You can even plug your own conflict manager if you need to.

With maven2, conflict management is quite simple: the principle is to get the nearest definition. So if your module depends on foo 1.0, none of your dependencies will ever manage to get foo 1.1 without a change in your own dependency declaration. It may be ok in some cases, it may not in others...

<h1>Flexibility</h1>
In ivy many things can be <a href="../doc/configuration.html">configured</a>, and many others can be <a href="../doc/extend.html">plugged in</a>: dependency resolvers, conflict manager, module descriptor parser, latest revision strategy, ... Maven2 also offers repository pluggability, but not much more as far as we know. Moreover, repository configuration seems to be less flexible than with ivy.

<h1>Public Repositories</h1>
Maven2 comes out of the box configured to use ibiblio maven2 repository, which contains <strong>a lot</strong> of modules (both artifacts and module descriptors). The only problem some may face is that module descriptors are not always checked, so some are not really well written.
Ivy, on its side, is used out of the box with ivyrep, ivy official repository, which contains only a few modules, and is not updated frequently. But it is also compatible with maven1 ibiblio repository (for artifacts only, no module descriptors), can also be used with maven2 repository (with pom compatibility, but you will here face some naming problems - that can be addressed using the namespace feature-, you won't benefit from ivy configurations with the module descriptors found there, and, let's face it, the maven2 compatibility of Ivy is far from maven's one :-)), and also has an ivyrep sandbox in which much more module descriptors can be found (not checked, as with ibiblio repository).

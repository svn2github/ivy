1. What is Apache Ivy?

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
   		Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
   		methodology or structure. 
   		Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
   		to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
   		processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
   		while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
   		with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
   		from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

2. Status of this release 

This release of Apache Ivy is the first release within the Apache Incubator,
and is labelled and should be considered as an alpha version.

This means that we do not guarantee any stability, that API and features are still 
likely to change until final 2.0.0 version, and thus we do not encourage the use 
of this version, except for very early testing.

The current production quality version is still 1.4.1, which has not been produced 
within the Apache Software Foundation.

3. Major Changes in this Release

This section describes what has changed between version 1.4.1 and this version of 
Apache Ivy.

This new version of Apache Ivy is fully compatible with previous versions as long as you do 
not use custom plugins: Ivy API has changed, but not its behavior:

Some tasks and configuration elements have been renamed, but the old versions
are still available, they are only deprecated (you will see deprecated warnings).

3.1. Java Package Name Changes

All of the Ivy Java package names have changed in Apache Ivy. They now start 
with org.apache rather than fr.jayasoft. There have been other changes as well. 
Important refactorings have done on the source code to ease the understanding
of Ivy internal architecture by new developers.

A class named org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 is provided with an API compatible with the
fr.jayasoft.Ivy class of Ivy 1.4.1, to ease migration to this new version.

3.2. Configuration replaced by Settings

Configuration used to have two meanings in prior Ivy versions, causing some confusion
with new users.
To avoid this confusion, Apache Ivy calls settings instead of configuration the files
used to customize Ivy. Configuration is still used for module configurations.

Besides the changes in the documentation, this renaming also imply a modification
in settings files, which now use ivysettings as root element instead of ivyconf,
and settings instead of conf element to define top level defaults (such as 
defaultCache, ...).
Previous names have been deprecated, so previous settings files can still be used, but 
you will see a deprecation warning.

3.3. public resolver in default settings is now ibiblio in m2 compatible mode

In previous versions Ivy used to use the ivyrep resolver as default public resolver, 
but ivyrep is no longer maintained, while maven 2 repository on ibiblio is growing rapidly.

Since Ivy is compatible with maven 2 repository, defaulting to the ibiblio maven 2 
repository makes more sense.

If you have any issue of backward compatibility with these new settings, you can simply 
set the following ant property before calling configure (implicitly or explicitly):
ivy.14.compatible=true

4. Migrating from Jayasoft Ivy to Apache Ivy

Apache Ivy is fully compatible with Jayasoft Ivy as long as you do not use 
custom plugins.
This means that you can use Apache Ivy as a drop in replacement of Jayasoft Ivy.

However due to the the renaming of configuration files to settings files, we
strongly suggest to update your configuration files:
- rename the files called ivyconf*.xml in ivysettings*.xml
- rename 'ivyconf' element in 'ivysettings'
- rename 'conf' element of those settings file in 'settings'

Migrating custom plugins can be done by using the org.apache.ivy.Ivy14 class
instead of fr.jayasoft.ivy.Ivy, and reorganizing your imports to reflect the 
changes in the package names.

5. How to Get Involved

The Apache Ivy project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/get-involved.html.

6. How to Report Issues

The Apache Ivy project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY

7. Committers and Contributors for this Release

Here is the list of people who have contributed source code and documentation
to this release. Many thanks to all of them, and also to the whole Ivy community
contributing ideas and feedback, and promoting the use of Ivy. The list would be too
long, but Ivy couldn't be what it is without you!
